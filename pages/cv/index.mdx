## Bachelor Thesis: Can Augmented Reality Support agile Software Development?

Research following the question if and how augmented reality can support agile sofware development.
Used to fix many bugs in the HoloLens SDK in the UI interactions. Lack of maintanance of the SDK due to the ongoing work on the HoloLens 2.

Technology:
* https://www.colyseus.io/ as a central node js server
* HoloLens 1 / C# / Unity
* Utilizing client side prediction to improve the usability of the application.
* Handling object locks during interactions.

## Happy 2 Help

Initiated the project happy 2 help with 5 of my former fellow students.
Coordinating the team and setting up an automated deployment up to "production" including TestFlight and PlayStore
Happy 2 Help facilitates the communication and organization of volunteer work. Non-profit organizations are given the opportunity to easily publish events and jobs they wish to get help for. Volunteers may apply for these jobs to announce their willingness to help. This makes volunteering more accessible and manageable. Via the application event creators can also confirm a volunteer's participation, who is then granted a certain amount of credit points. With these a user is allowed to create his own events to ask for help for everyday tasks and problems.
