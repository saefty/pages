## Bachelor Thesis: Can Augmented Reality Support agile Software Development?

Research following the question if and how augmented reality can support agile sofware development.
Implemented an AR Application for the HoloLens to allow using three dimensinal items in multi-user sessions for Scrum Poker.
The tool showed many difficulties in the inconvenient UX patterns provided by the system.
Used to fix many bugs in the HoloLens SDK in the UI interactions. Lack of maintanance of the SDK due to the ongoing work on the HoloLens 2.

Technology:

- https://www.colyseus.io/ as a central node js server
- HoloLens 1 / C# / Unity
- Utilise client side prediction to improve the UX of the application.
- Handling object locks during interactions.

## Happy 2 Help

Initiated the project happy 2 help with 5 of my former fellow students.
Coordinating the team and setting up an automated deployment up to "production" including TestFlight and PlayStore
Happy 2 Help facilitates the communication and organisation of volunteer work. Non-profit organisations are given the opportunity to easily publish events and jobs they wish to get help for. Volunteers may apply for these jobs to announce their willingness to help. This makes volunteering more accessible and manageable. Via the application event creators can also confirm a volunteer's participation, who is then granted a certain amount of credit points. With these a user is allowed to create his own events to ask for help for everyday tasks and problems.
